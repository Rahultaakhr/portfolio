                    Hey there! I'm Rahul ðŸ‘‹, a full-stack developer with a passion for creating technology that makes a real difference. 
                    I specialize in React Native, MERN stack, and TypeScript, but what truly excites me is the opportunity to build things that solve problems 
                    and make people's lives a little easier.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4 text-shadow-sm">
                    Coding for me isnâ€™t just about writing clean code â€” itâ€™s about crafting experiences that feel intuitive, seamless, and impactful. 
                    Whether Iâ€™m building mobile apps or developing full-stack solutions, I approach every project with the same enthusiasm and drive to 
                    make it the best it can be.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4 text-shadow-sm">
                    When I'm not deep in code, youâ€™ll probably find me with a cup of coffee in hand, learning something new, or brainstorming ideas for my next project. 
                    I love connecting with other passionate creators, so feel free to reach out â€” letâ€™s collaborate and make something amazing together!
